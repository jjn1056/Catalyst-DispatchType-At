=head1 NAME

Catalyst::ActionChainNext - Chain of Catalyst Actions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Catalyst::Manual::Intro> for more info about Chained actions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a chain of Catalyst Actions. It behaves exactly like
the action at the *end* of the chain except on dispatch it will execute all
the actions in the chain in order.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 chain

Accessor for the action chain; will be an arrayref of the Catalyst::Action
objects encapsulated by this chain.

=head2 dispatch( $c )

Dispatch this action chain against a context; will dispatch the encapsulated
actions in order.

=head2 from_chain( \@actions )

Takes a list of Catalyst::Action objects and constructs and returns a
Catalyst::ActionChain object representing a chain of these actions

=head2 number_of_captures

Returns the total number of captures for the entire chain of actions.

=head2 match_captures

Match all the captures that this chain encloses, if any.

=head2 scheme

Any defined scheme for the actionchain

=head2 next ( @args)

Dispatches to the next action in the chain immediately. If there are no more actions in the
chain, this is basically a no-op.  When the last action in the chain returns, we will return
to the action that called next and continue processing.  The return value of next is the
return value of the last action in the chain or whatever $c->state is set to.  Please note
that since C<state> is a scalar, you cannot return a list of values from an action chain.  If
you want to return a list you must return an arrayref or hashref.  This limitation is due to
longstanding code in L<Catalyst> that is not easily changed without breaking backwards 
compatibility.

You can call C<next> in as many actions in a long chain as you want and the chain will correctly
return to the last action that called C<next> based on order of execution.

Any arguments you pass to C<next> will be passed to the next action in the chain as C<< $c->request->arguments >>.
They will be added onto the end of any existing arguement that the action itself defines.
